Description:

What is Crowd Wave?
Crowd Wave is an app to generate crowd wavesâ€“a sound wave that is created by a crowd. The app gets users to alternate between cheering wildly and complete silence in random intervals. It's like a flash mob for tactical cheering.

How does it work?
Over the course of human history, our senses have evolvedâ€“as a matter of survivalâ€“to process patterns, like when a tiger is moving towards us in a jungle. This pattern processing capability makes us sensitive to things that don't fit the normal course of events. So, when the other team's player is at the free-throw line, one continuous loud cheer is actually easier to ignore than multiple random bursts of cheers.

How to use it?
It's simple. Merely hold up your phone in front of you and cheer when the screen is orange, and be silent when it's black. The white countdown meter will even help you to better time your cheers. Recruit those around you to join in for a greater impact!

Pro Tip: check out the settings feature to get your camera flash to flash on and off randomly for an even bigger impact.
